# xamarin-accountancy-app
This app is a project assigned by "Radius College". This project is a test exam to prepare for the exams of our study. DaWheelz(Bas) & SieBRUM(Siebren) work on this project together. 

This application is build in Xamarin C#, and is written only for UWP (due to time restrictions). Although we might port it to Android and/or iOS. 

The purpose of this application is to keep track of the hours worked, and be able to see a quick overview of the worked hours + total earned money. Also generating an invoice based on the montly stats is a functionality. 

# Files

Almost all of the coding is done in the shared project. Only the platform specific code is written in the platform specific projects (like database storing location). These files will be injected in the shared project, using dependency injection. All database mapping files are located in the "Database" folder in the main project. Pages are always have the "Page" suffix.

# Testing
This app does not have unit tests enabled, but this is on the roadmap. We are aiming for ~85% unittest coverage.

# Documentation

Almost all documentation is synced to our private "Google Drive" folder. To get read permission to those files, please contact one of the project leaders (DaWheelz & SieBRUM).

# Publication
This project will not be published due to it being a project assigned by school.
